# WOFOST-CLOUD (Proof Of Concept)

## Acknowledgement
This source code has been developed largely in the context of the AgInfra+
EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, and has received funding
from the European Union under grant agreement No 731001.

## License
All code written as part of this project is released with the European Union
Public License v. 1.2. This does not include the code for the WOFOST crop 
simulation model which is available separately (as a compiled library) from
Wageningen University and Research (https://www.wur.nl/) and has more strict
license conditions.

## Status
This source code is provided as-is, and taken as a sample from the project's
original repository that is still under active development. Please read the
code with that in mind, you will find many things marked as to-do's or waiting
for improvements. The code is mostly shared so that parts of it can be re-used
and serve as inspiration for future work. To create an operational system from
it, you will need a copy of the crop simulation model (or something to replace
it), a D4Science cluster and VRE (Virtual Research Environment), and various
service API access tokens. This should be possible but will take some effort.
